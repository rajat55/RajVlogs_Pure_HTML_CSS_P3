      <h1>Changes in Life Essay</h1>
      <p>
        Change can occur in many different ways and is dealt with in many
        different ways. I have come to the awareness that change can be the
        deepest of all things.

        In my life, I have been exposed to a challenge called change. Change can
        occur in many different ways and is dealt with in many different ways. I
        have come to the awareness that change can be the deepest of all things.
        I always thought that change occurred when you moved to a state or when
        you lost someone real close to you. Those are a challenge to change,
        yes, but change doesn't have to occur over a climactic incident. It can
        just appear overnight when your brain winds up when it's time to do
        something different. Even with friends that you used to have and know
        that move on. For example, most of my friends from elementary school, I
        don't even talk to them anymore. For obvious reasons, people will turn
        down the changes in life.

        Its depressing how this works, but its probably the most reason why
        people change. Its much like peer pressure which usually ends up in the
        wrong direction. For example, I was almost peer pressured to consume
        alcohol and to do smoking. Fortunately, for me, I escaped that change
        and didnt experience it. The people we adore love us so much that they
        want us to remain the way we are forever. Like how my mother always
        wanted me to stay the same little child, but I grew up. Not all people
        can stay the same for a long time. If the people we love and adore would
        just accept the change and go with it, they would understand where the
        change was coming from. It can be shaky to try to stop change and fight
        against it, especially if the person wants to change a lot. When I was
        ready for high school, I was expected to change almost everything in my
        life. The reason that somebody wants to change is usually not their
        choice, but a feeling that the person feels inside their head. Maybe the
        change isnt the best change, but if you dig deeper, the person that you
        adore isnt really changing. They are just trying to find themselves and
        the one thing they need the most is the support of the people who they
        care about the most.

Even if we know, logically, that our situation has changed, it can be difficult to get that change to really sink in. Many of our interviewees described a key event that “flipped a switch” for them: a tipping point that empowered them to make (and truly accept) a change. For example, some participants who were trying to leave behind stigmatized pasts spoke about the significance of a specific milestone, such as a birthday or the birth of a child, in helping them to embrace their new identities. One person told us how after two days in the hospital, he decided that the moment he woke up would be his rebirth, explaining that the experience marked the end of his past in a symbolically meaningfully way.
